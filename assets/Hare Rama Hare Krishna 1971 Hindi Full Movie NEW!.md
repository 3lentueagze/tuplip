The film is set in the backdrop of the rise of the International Hare Krishna movement in the 1970s, and revolves around a Montreal-based family of the Jaiswals, who get separated due to irreconcilable differences. Jasbir, the daughter, goes with her mother to Canada, while Prashant, the son, stays with his father in India. Years later, Prashant travels to Kathmandu to find his sister, who has joined a group of hippies and adopted the name Janice. He tries to persuade her to return to India and reunite with their father, but faces resistance from her hippie friends and her drug-addicted boyfriend.
 
The film was inspired by Dev Anand's encounter with a hippie girl in Nepal during the making of his previous film Prem Pujari. He decided to make a film on the hippie culture and its impact on Indian youth. He also introduced R.D. Burman as the music director, who composed some of the most memorable songs of Hindi cinema, such as "Dum Maro Dum", "Phoolon Ka Taron Ka" and "Kanchi Re Kanchi". The film was also noted for its realistic portrayal of the hippie lifestyle and its social commentary on drug abuse, alienation and spiritual quest.
