ASTM C150 is the standard specification for Portland cement, which is the most common type of cement used in construction. Portland cement is a hydraulic cement that sets and hardens by reacting with water and forms a water-resistant product. ASTM C150 covers eight types of Portland cement with different chemical compositions and physical properties.

Portland cement is one of the most widely used materials in the construction industry. It is the main ingredient of concrete, mortar, stucco, and grout. Portland cement can be used for various applications, such as building foundations, bridges, dams, roads, tunnels, pipes, and sculptures. Portland cement can also be mixed with other materials to create special types of cement, such as blended cement, masonry cement, expansive cement, and white cement.
 
To ensure the quality and performance of Portland cement, it is important to follow the specifications and requirements of ASTM C150. ASTM C150 provides guidelines for the chemical composition, physical properties, and testing methods of Portland cement. ASTM C150 also classifies Portland cement into eight types based on their characteristics and intended use. These types are:
